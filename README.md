# ImageClassification
This is another project I completed when I worked as a software intern in Upbeat Technology. This program aims to distingush three different hand
gestures on NodeMCU, including rock, paper, and scissor. I created CNN by using Keras and Tensorflow, and achieved 97 accuracy at last. For more 
reference, please see the power point file in the repository.

I spent lots of time implementing image augmentation functions from scartch because I could not import any existing library back then.
